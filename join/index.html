                We meet in Barrios's room (301, right next to the small staff parking lot)
                every first and third Thursday. Come on in!
            </p>

            <h3>Some Prerequisites...</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>No coding experience needed!</dt>
                <dd>
                    ...okay fine, you need a VERY small amount of coding experience.
                    but we've got you covered... we've amassed about a million
                    learning resources for everything and anything we work with.
                </dd>

                <dt>A personal email</dt>
                <dd>
                    Almost essential. We make a lot of accounts for so many different things
                    and it will be much easier to have a personal email. (and personal emails
                    don't get deleted after you graduate!) see: 
                    <a 
                        href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en"
                        target="_blank">
                        Create a Gmail account (opens in new tab)
                    </a>
                </dd>

                <dt>A GitHub account</dt>
                <dd>
                    Some of our projects will be hosted on GitHub. We'll add you to our club's
                    organization page. yea.
                </dd>

                <dt>Join our Remind</dt>
                <dd>
                    It's good to be in the know so join it! [@bhs-codes]<br>
                    (you can text that code to 81010 or download the remind app.)
                </dd>

                <dt>..and fill out this form</dt>
                <dd>
                    I promise it's not that long... it really just checks your experience with coding
                    (which, again, you don't need)
                </dd>
